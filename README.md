# Sorting-Visualizer
Sorting Visualizer: Interactive Algorithm Learning Tool

The Sorting Visualizer is a web-based application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to visually understand and explore different sorting algorithms. The visualizer dynamically illustrates how sorting algorithms rearrange arrays step by step, helping users grasp their underlying mechanics.

Key Features:
Intuitive Design: The app presents an array of vertical bars representing data elements, where the height of each bar corresponds to the value of the element. Users can select the size of the array and the speed of the visualization.

Interactive Controls:

Start, pause, and reset the visualizer at any point during the sorting process.
Adjust the size of the array and the speed of the sorting algorithm in real time.
Supported Algorithms:
Bubble Sort:

A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. The visualizer shows how adjacent elements are swapped repeatedly until the entire array is sorted.
Selection Sort:

The visualizer demonstrates how the smallest element from the unsorted section is selected and placed in its correct position at each iteration.
Heap Sort:

A tree-based sorting algorithm. Watch as the visualizer builds a max-heap and then removes elements from the heap one by one to sort the array.
Merge Sort:

A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. The visualizer splits the array into smaller sub-arrays and merges them back together in a sorted order, showcasing its recursive nature.
Quick Sort:

Another divide-and-conquer algorithm. The visualizer highlights the partitioning process as the array is divided around a pivot, gradually sorting the array.
Insertion Sort:

The algorithm inserts each element into its correct position. The visualizer demonstrates how each element is placed into the sorted section of the array.
Customization Options:
Array Size: Adjust the number of elements in the array.
Speed Control: Vary the speed of the sorting process to observe the algorithms at different paces.
Step-by-Step Execution: Visualize each step of the algorithm to understand the logic clearly.
